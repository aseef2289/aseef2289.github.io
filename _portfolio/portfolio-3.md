Tech Stack:  Python, Pandas, Plotly, Excel

Used Excel to investigate the use of normal distributions in modelling the 2020 COVID-19 recession to see its impacts.

Dealt with large data sets including S&P 500 closing values from 2013 to 2023, totalling to 2500 data points.

Modelled normal Distribution using Excel, VBA scripting and pivot tables to found mean and normal distribution values.

Used the z-score to find the probability of specific percentage increases/decreases during the pandemic and during a period of
economic growth and compared how it impacted our economy. Aiming to expand analysis via Pandas and Plotly visualizations
