Tech Stack:  Python, Yelp Fusion API, Tkinter

Integrated the Yelp Fusion API to fetch restaurant data based on user-provided location and to retrieve and display real-time data.

Developed a user-friendly Python application with a GUI (Graphical User Interface) using Tkinter that took user input to help
users find halal restaurants nearby.

Enabled users to enter their location and initiate a search for halal restaurants and visually displayed restaurant information,
including name, rating, and address, within the application
